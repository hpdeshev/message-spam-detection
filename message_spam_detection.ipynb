    "## Introduction\n",
    "This project demonstrates and compares various message spam detection methods by implementing a general ham/spam binary classification task on datasets obtained from:\n",
    "- [SpamAssassin public mail corpus](#SpamAssassin-public-mail-corpus)\n",
    "- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](#SMS-Spam-Collection---UCI-Machine-Learning-Repository)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ham/spam binary classification task is implemented by utilization of the following two groups of [machine learning models](#Machine-learning-models):\n",
    "- [bag-of-words (BoW)](#Bag-of-words)\n",
    "  - [naive Bayes](#Naive-Bayes)\n",
    "  - [logistic regression](#Logistic-regression)\n",
    "  - [decision trees](#Decision-tree)\n",
    "  - [support vector machines](#Support-vector-machine)\n",
    "  - [ensembles - bagging (voting), boosting, stacking](#Ensemble-learning)\n",
    "- [bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)](#BERT)\n",
    "\n",
    "The message spam data is modeled in two different ways depending on the classification approach:\n",
    "- [term frequency–inverse document frequency (`TF-IDF`)](#TF-IDF), a \"normalized\" `BoW` text model,\n",
    "  together with custom [feature engineering](#Feature-engineering)\n",
    "- [word embeddings for neural natural language processing](#Word-embedding)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the wide-spread application of the `BoW` approach for text classification and the presence of many `BoW`-based methods (some of them mentioned above), the main focus is to build a high-performance `BoW` classifier, while a `BERT` classifier is used mainly to point out the specifics of using `BERT` as an alternative approach for text classification. So the `BoW` model with best metrics is selected for comparison with a `BERT` model, though some [limitations](#Limitations) apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the `BoW` classifiers is based on [Scikit-learn](#Scikit-learn) and the `Scikit-learn` terms for *estimator*, *transformer* and *predictor* are used.\n",
    "The implementation of the `BERT` classifier is based on [Hugging Face Transformers](#Hugging-Face-Transformers) and [PyTorch](#PyTorch).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple trade-offs between the `BoW` and `BERT` approaches, and this project attempts to empirically show the strong and weak points of each of the two approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "`BoW` models can work with very long text sequences at the expense of reduced contextual interpretation of word order and grouping. For the latter, as a compensation, `BoW` models can statistically process groups of word-tokens (`n-grams`) but this is not a substitute for technologies like `word2vec`, [Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)](#Recurrent-neural-network) and [Attention](#Attention), which are applied in neural networks like `BERT` and together allow for capturing phrases or bidirectional interdependencies within a sequence of input word-tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, `BoW` models provide better explainability on how their algorithm works and how the classification output is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## File structure\n",
    "### Folders (packages)\n",

    "- *pipeline*: Training a `BoW` text classifier based on a `Scikit-learn` pipeline.\n",

    "- Various configuration and setup files, such as *luigi.cfg*.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a name=\"Limitations\"></a>\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "If in *luigi.cfg* is set `classification.feature_selector_type=svd` and a `BoW` model is built to use a feature selector, then `BoW`-`BERT` comparison is not supported for this `BoW` model. This limitation is due to unavailable `TF-IDF` feature information when dimensionality reduction is applied before the classifier in a pipeline."
